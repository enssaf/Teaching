"## 📑 Overview\n",
"Prompt engineering is a discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to effectively interact with Large Language Models (LLMs). This lecture covers settings, core techniques, and advanced reasoning frameworks.\n",

"## ⚙️ Part 1: LLM Settings\n",
"Configurable parameters influence the randomness, length, and diversity of model responses.\n",

"| Parameter | Impact | Usage |\n",
"| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
"| Temperature | Controls randomness | 0.2 for facts, 0.8 for creativity |\n",
"| Top P | Nucleus Sampling | Range of possible next words |\n",
"| Max Length | Token Limit | Prevents long, irrelevant outputs |\n",
"| Penalties | Repetition Control | Frequency/Presence penalties for variety |"
